# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction

A simple project using basic ML models to predict flight delays.

## ✅ Models
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine  
- Decision Tree  

## 📊 Results
- Best accuracy: ~65%  
- Dataset: U.S. domestic flights ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay))

## 🧠 To Do
- Use GridSearchCV for tuning  
- Try ensemble methods (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Better feature selection & scaling  

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: ML code & experiments
